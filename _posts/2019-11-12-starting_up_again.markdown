I just came back from a month long break from coding and jumping right back has been a little tough. I think the hardest part about coding for me is figuring out when to use certain methods for the labs. I am getting used it a bit more and learning more about using the error messages and specs to help more. I am having trouble figuring out how to reinforce the ideas in my head as well but I have been doing a lot of re-reading for the ideas I can't grasp. Hopefully it will get a bit easier as I figure out what works best for me.
